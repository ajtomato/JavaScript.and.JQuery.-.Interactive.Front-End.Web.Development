# JavaScript and JQuery: Interactive Front-End Web Development

## 1. The ABC of Programming

### What is a script and how do I create one?

### How do computers fit in with the world around them?

The models use objects to represent physical things. Objects can have:

* properties that tell you about the object
* methods that perform tasks using the properties of that object
* events which are triggered when a user interacts with the computer

The browser represents each window or tab using a *window* object. The *location* property of the *window* object will tell you the URL of the current page.

The current web page loaded into each window is modelled using a *document* object. The *title* property of the *document* object tells you what is between the opening *\<title\>* and closing *\</title\>* tag for that web page, and the *lastModified* property of the *document* object tells you the date this page was last updated.

The *document* object represents an html page.

When the browser creates a model of a web page, it not only creates a *document* object, but it also creates a new object for each element on the page. Together these objects are described in the *Document Object Model*.

### How do I write a script for a web page?

* CONTENT LAYER: .html files, this is where the content of the page lives. The HTML gives the page structure and adds semantics.
* PRESENTATION LAYER: .css files, the CSS enhances the HTML page with rules that state how the HTML content is presented (backgrounds, borders, box dimensions, colors, fonts, etc.).
* BEHAVIOR LAYER: .js files, this is where we can change how the page behaves, adding interactivity.

Most of the scripts are added just before the closing \</body\> tag (this is often considered a better place to put your scripts).

JavaScript runs where it is found in the html.
